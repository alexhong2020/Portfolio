HELLO!

Welcome to Checkers. Weed out the instagram fakes with this tool. 

1. Go to instagram.com and request a data download in .json format. You will need followers and following folders. https://www.instagram.com/download/request/
3. Copy over .json files (followers and following) to `checkers.py`
4. Checkers will automatically convert the .json file to a .txt file for analysis.
5. Hit Run in checkers.py to see who unfollowed you!

- main.py, followers.txt, following.txt are main functional classes. Others are for test beta purposes.
- Mon 06.27.22: Added checkers.md and refactored checkers.py to NOT require you to enter input files (autopickup files).
- Thu 12.21.23: Major update where entire processed is streamlined. Code added to automatically convert .json to .txt natively. Converting from .json to .csv first is no longer required on user end.
